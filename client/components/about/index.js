        It’s hard to make the best even better, but the sequel to Day One lives up to
        expectations—and
        then some.The app smartly keeps its interface streamlined but adds a wealth of new features
        that we’ve found immensely valuable. Your journal entries contain all sorts of
        information—you can geolocate them, add tons of photos to each entry and even see
        your day’s fitness activity. You can switch over to a beautiful new photo view when you’re
        ready to see your world at a glance.
